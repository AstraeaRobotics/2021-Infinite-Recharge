Please create a pull request for all new features so our github actions will be able to build it and run unit tests


You can use github destkop + vscode as a local development environment to build + deploy

If you don't have a computer you can install stuff on, repl.it allows you to develop on the go (it supports github as well). You can build your code, you just can't deploy
